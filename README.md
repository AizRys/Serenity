Serenity Sample Project
=================
[Serenity](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-core) is a tool that lets you use WebDriver-based unit or BDD tests to write more flexible and more reusable WebDriver-based tests, and also to generate documentation about your acceptance tests, including a narrative description of test, along with the corresponding screen shots, and also high-level summaries and aggregations of the test results
It provides support for running tests and advanced reporting by using BDD.
